Our vision: science is for everyone
Science underpins every facet of our lives from the basic decisions we make about what to eat to how we communicate with each other. Everyone should have should have the opportunity to learn more about the world around them - even adults!

About us: 
We are a Wellington based company in New Zealand, Aotearoa. The name Fishhook was inspired by the Maori constellation Te Matau a Maui - the fish hook that the legendary Maui used to catch the giant fish that became the North Island of New Zealand. Maui’s fish hook was immortalized in the skies as a constellation that you may also know as Scorpius. 

Fish hook science studio was born out of our desire to demystify science and create opportunities for people, turned off of science as children, to reconnect and re-engage with science as adults. Our team consists of young entrepreneurs and scientists with backgrounds in biotechnology, engineering, computer science and astronomy. We are all dedicated to good science communication and have experience in teaching, tourism and tutoring of various science subjects. 


Fishhook workshops coming soon:

DNA cocktail night - join us for a night of fantastic fruit cocktails and demystifying genetics. Extract DNA using alcohol and then drink your experiment!

Space Kitchen - learn about how stars are born, how planets are formed and what conditions are needed for life as we know it! Compete with other teams to be the first to build a habitable planet using physical ingredients with digital outcomes. 

Open Mike night - open up poor Mike and figure out how he died before the other teams! Dissection throughout the ages. What do we know now compared to the ancient Romans or Victorians. Using augmented reality to perform a dissection you can choose your own level of gruesomeness.
